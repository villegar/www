The goal of `trainR` is to provide a simple interface to the 
National Rail Enquiries (NRE) systems. There are few data feeds 
available, the simplest of them is Darwin, which provides real-time 
arrival and departure predictions, platform numbers, delay estimates, 
schedule changes and cancellations. Other data feeds provide historical 
data, Historic Service Performance (HSP), and much more. `trainR` 
simplifies the data retrieval, so that the users can focus on their 
analyses. For more details visit 
https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/46391.aspx.

## Installation

You can install the released version of trainR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("trainR")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("villegar/trainR", "dev")
```

## Setup
Before starting to retrieve data from the NRE data feeds, you must obtain an access token. 
Visit the following website for details: http://realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWSRegistration/

Once you have received your access token, you have to store it in the `.Renviron` file; this can be 
done by executing the following command:


```r
trainR::set_token()
```

This will open a text file, `.Renviron`, add a new line at the end (as follows):

```bash
NRE="<token>"
```

`<token>` should be replaced by the access token obtained from the NRE. Save the changes and restart 
your R session.

You only need to perform this configuration once.
